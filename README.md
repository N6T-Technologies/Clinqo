#### 4. Start Docker Services
```bash
# Start Redis and PostgreSQL containers
docker compose up -d

# To pause development environment
docker compose pause

```bash
yarn prisma studio  
```

#### 7. Start the Services
```bash
# Start shefu and ws services
chmod +x service.sh  # if running for the first time
./service.sh

# Start the hospital client
cd apps/hospital-client
yarn run build
yarn run start
```
